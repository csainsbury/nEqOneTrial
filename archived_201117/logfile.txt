sequence:
1 run generateDrugData_forRNN.R # 111117 - simplified drugs introduced with top 25 drug classess now used rather than individual drug names

2 run generateInputFilesForRNN_hb_bp_bmi2_originalFile.R to generate age file
3 place output data in ./sourceData
4 generate data for python3 with generate_drugPlusOtherParams_forPython.R


generateDrugData_forRNN.R
# generates the drug data for the RNN (for embedding). generates the combinations according to time bins defined in sequence. 1/30 for a 5y runin gives 2 month bins.

# other datasets are in ./sourceData - from prior 2/3 param RNNs

# plan to embed the drug data and then keras merge with other data
